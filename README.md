## System Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements listed in this section. If your computer doesn't match up to most of these requirements, you may have a problem using the contents of the CD.

- A Windows PC with Microsoft Excel 2007.
- A CD-ROM drive.

========================================================================
## Using the CD
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the items from the CD to your hard drive, follow these steps:

1.  Insert the CD into your computer's CD drive. The license agreement appears.

**Note** The interface won't launch if you have autorun disabled. In that case, click Start-->Run. In the dialog box that appears, type D:\start.exe (Replace D with the proper letter if your CD drive uses a different letter. If you don't know the letter, see how your CD drive is listed under My Computer). Click OK.

2.  Read through the license agreement, and then click the Accept button if you want to use the CD. After you click Accept, the License Agreement window won't appear again.

The CD interface appears. The interface allows you to install the programs and run the demos with just a click of a button (or two).

========================================================================
## What's on the CD
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following sections provide more details about the software and other materials available on the CD.

eBook version of Excel 2007 Bible

The complete text of the book you hold in your hands is provided on the CD in Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF). You can read and quickly search the content of this PDF file by using Adobe's Acrobat Reader, also included on the CD.

Shareware programs are fully functional, trial versions of copyrighted programs. If you like particular programs, register with their authors for a nominal fee and receive licenses, enhanced versions, and technical support.

Freeware programs are copyrighted games, applications, and utilities that are free for personal use. Unlike shareware, these programs do not require a fee or provide technical support.

GNU software is governed by its own license, which is included inside the folder of the GNU product. See the GNU license for more details.

Trial, demo, or evaluation versions are usually limited either by time or functionality (such as being unable to save projects). Some trial versions are very sensitive to system date changes. If you alter your computer's date, the programs will "time out" and will no longer be functional.

Sample files for the Excel 2007 Bible

The files discussed in the book are organized by chapter. With a few exceptions, the files are all Excel 2007 files that have either of the following extensions:

- XLSX: An Excel workbook file
- XLSM: An Excel workbook file that contains VBA macros

When you open an XLSM file, Excel may display a Security Warning and tells you that macros have been disabled. To enable macros, click the Options button in the Security Warning panel and then select the option labeled Enable This Content.

Because the files on this CD are from a trusted source, you may want to copy the files to your hard drive and then designate the folder as a trusted location. To do so, follow these steps:

1.  Open an Explorer window, and select the CD-ROM drive that contains the companion CD-ROM.
2.  Right-click the folder that corresponds to the root folder for the samples files, and choose Copy from the shortcut menu.
3.  Activate the folder on your hard drive where you'd like to copy the files. Right-click the directory, and choose Paste from the shortcut menu.

The CD-ROM files will be copied to a subfolder in the folder you specified in Step 3. To designate this new folder as a trusted location:
1.  Start Excel and choose Office-->Excel Options to display the Excel Options dialog box.
2.  In the Excel Options dialog box, click the Trust Center tab.
3.  Click the Trust Center Settings button.
4.  In the Trust Center dialog box, click the Trusted Locations tab.
5.  Click the Add New Location button to display the Microsoft Office Trusted Location dialog box.
6.  In the Microsoft Office Trusted Location dialog box, click the Browse button and locate the folder that contains the files copied from the CD-ROM.
7.  Make sure that you select the option labeled Subfolders Of This Location Are Also Trusted.

After performing these steps, when you open XLSM files from this location, the macros are enabled and you don't see the security warning.

## Troubleshooting
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have difficulty installing or using any of the materials on the companion CD, try the following solutions:

- Turn off any antivirus software that you may have running. Installers sometimes mimic virus activity and can make your computer incorrectly believe that it is being infected by a virus (Be sure to turn the antivirus software back on later).

- Close all running programs. The more programs you're running, the less memory is available to other programs. Installers also typically update files and programs; if you keep other programs running, installation may not work properly.

### Customer Care
